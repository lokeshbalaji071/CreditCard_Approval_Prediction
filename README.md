"# FinalProject_CreditCard_Approval_Prediction"

•	Developed a Machine learning model on Credit card approval by merging large datasets which helps us to determine whether the customer is eligible for sanctioning credit based on Accuracy and F1 Score metrics

•	Performed preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset and obtained understanding of data through visualization using matplotlib and seaborn 

•	Implemented feature importance on the dataset using Random forest Model and implemented Randomized SearchCV for  hyper parameter tuning 

•	Implemented various models such as XG Boost, Deep Neural Network, Decision Trees, KNN and optimized those models
